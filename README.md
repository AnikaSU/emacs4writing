# emacs.d
My emacs configuration, optimized for creative writing.

# Prerequisites
You need to install a font and MultiMarkdown before attempting to install/run/use this Emacs configuration.

## Fonts
This Emacs configuration uses Open Sans, except on Windows, where Source Sans Pro is used. 
The problem with Source Sans Pro, is that it doesn't support rendering the bullet types that Org-bullets wants, but Windows lags considerably with Open Sans ...

### Linux, Mac
Install Open Sans if it's not already installed on your system.

### Windows
On Windows, install Adobe's [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) font. 

## Markdown
Install [MultiMarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6/releases) - most Linux distributions have MultiMarkdown in their package repositories; otherwise, use the Github release page to fetch it.
