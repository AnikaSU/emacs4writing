# emacs.d
My emacs configuration, optimized for creative writing.

## Prerequisites ##

You need to install a font and MultiMarkdown before attempting to install/run/use this Emacs configuration.

### Fonts ###

Install Open Sans if it's not already installed on your system.

### Markdown ###

While the primary focus of this Emacs configuration is to work with Org files, I think that, for a writer, the ability to handle Markdown properly is a must.
Markdown is like Org-mode: it is non-proprietary plain text.

Therefore, you need to install [MultiMarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6/releases) - most Linux distributions have MultiMarkdown in their package repositories; otherwise (like, if using Windows), use the Github release page to fetch it.

## Installation ##
### Windows ###
**Important!**
You need to set the `HOME` environment variable to point to your user directory (usually `c:/Users/[username]`)

## How to use it ##
See my [Creative Writing with Emacs](https://jacmoes.wordpress.com/2019/09/24/creative-writing-with-emacs/) blog post.
