# emacs.d
My emacs configuration, optimized for creative writing.

## Prerequisites ##

You need to install a font and MultiMarkdown before attempting to install/run/use this Emacs configuration.

### Fonts ###

This Emacs configuration uses Open Sans, except on Windows, where Source Sans Pro is used. 
The problem with Source Sans Pro, is that it doesn't support rendering the bullet types that Org-bullets wants, but Windows lags considerably with Open Sans ...

#### Linux, Mac ####

Install Open Sans if it's not already installed on your system.

#### Windows ####

On Windows, install Adobe's [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) font. 

### Markdown ###

While the primary focus of this Emacs configuration is to work with Org files, I think that, for a writer, the ability to handle Markdown properly is a must.
Markdown is like Org-mode: it is non-proprietary plain text.

Therefore, you need to install [MultiMarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6/releases) - most Linux distributions have MultiMarkdown in their package repositories; otherwise (like, if using Windows), use the Github release page to fetch it.

## Installation ##
### Windows ###
**Important!**
You need to set the `HOME` environment variable to point to your user directory (usually `c:/Users/[username]`)
